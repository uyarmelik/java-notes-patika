## Answer 1
[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> [<b>2</b>,27,16,<b>22</b>,18,6] -> [2,<b>6</b>,16,22,18,<b>27</b>] -> [2,6,<b>16</b>,22,18,27] -> [2,6,16,<b>18</b>,<b>22</b>,27] -> [2,6,16,18,<b>22</b>,27]

## Answer 2
O(nÂ²) -> O(6Â²) -> O(36)

## Answer 3
<b>Average Case:</b> The searched number is in the middle
<b>Worst Case:</b> The searched number is at the end
<b>Best Case:</b> The searched number is at the beginning of the array

## Answern 4
Average Case

## Answer 5
[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] -> [<b>2</b>,3,5,8,<b>7</b>,9,4,15,6] -> [2,<b>3</b>,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] -> [2,3,<b>4</b>,8,7,9,<b>5</b>,15,6] -> [2,3,4,<b>5</b>,7,9,<b>8</b>,15,6]

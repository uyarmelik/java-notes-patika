1. Write the stages of the given array according to the sorting algorithm.
2. Write the Big-O notation.

## Answer 1
[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> [16,21,11] [8,12,22] -> [16] [21,11] [8,12] [22] -> [16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22] -> [11,16,21] [8,12,22] -> [8,11,12,16,21,22]

## Answer 2
O(n.log(n)) -> O(6.log(6)) -> O(4.6689075023)
